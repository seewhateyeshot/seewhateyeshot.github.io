It was partly an escape from the Swedish winter, partly wanderlust. I’d heard of Pattaya before—maybe from him, maybe just from its reputation. Either way, I was curious. I had three weeks of vacation from my software engineering job, which was draining the life out of me, and I decided to take it all.`

    content: `But by September, our informal kitchen classes came to an end. It was time for my teacher to return to Pattaya, Thailand, where he spent his winters. He wasn't the typical sex tourist—rather, staying in a friend’s apartment in Thailand rent-free made financial sense, and so did escaping another Swedish winter. In fact, he had been talking about photographing Pattaya long before I even picked up a camera, though by now, I think he’s too disinterested to photograph and publish another book.

    He gave me a key to his apartment though and I spent long hours in his home library. He owns more than a thousand books—mostly doorstops, many by masters, quite a few signed to his name. I’d leaf through monographs, street photography collections, retrospective volumes. I cataloged them all for him, and helped sell a few in his absence, hoping it might help his finances.

    That winter, Stockholm felt lifeless. Colder and darker than usual. My job was draining me. I was buried under my mortgage and rising interest rates. I could barely afford to do the things I used to. I'd spend what little remained of my salary on a few screenings at the film festival, then scraping by on potatoes till the end of the month. Street photography no longer gave me the same spark. Maybe it’s a weak excuse, but I still think Stockholm isn’t the most exciting place for photography—too clean, too quiet, too conforming.

    We stayed in touch often. When I asked him about visiting him in Thailand, he said I could come. He had a place for me to stay—the vacant unit next door was his friend’s too. I asked if three weeks, all I could take off from work, would be too long. He said, “You can stay here rent-free for as long as you want.”`

    I had broken my camera back in Stockholm just before the trip. I worried I wouldn’t be able to photograph anything—especially after all the hype about Pattaya’s sex tourism—but he lent me his: the older Fujifilm X-Pro1 I had practiced with during the summer. We shared the same 18mm f/2.0 lens. The setup was lightweight, unimposing. Just wide enough for the kind of close, intimate frames I wanted. Not the best in low light, but somehow the softness suited the city.`

            I was hungry for all of it. Everything was new.
            At first, I photographed whatever caught my eye—stray dogs, food carts, fish markets, signs I couldn’t read.
            I was especially drawn to international couples.
            Whenever I saw an older Western man—what locals call a <i>farang</i>—paired with a young, striking Thai woman—a common sight in Pattaya—I felt a strong urge to photograph it.
            The contrast spoke volumes. But what struck me just as much was the silence between them.
            I rarely saw them talk.
            They’d sit next to each other at a bar or restaurant, their bodies close but their eyes elsewhere—on their phones,
            on the street, on nothing in particular.

    On my first night, after dinner, we went for a walk down Beach Road—something that quickly became our daily ritual. Halfway along, we reached the entrance to the notorious Walking Street. My teacher led me in.

    The chaos hit immediately. Crowds of tourists clogged the narrow street. Clubs blaring different music from every side, the air thick with smoke and neon. Scantily dressed women rushed around in every direction. Vendors thrust laminated flyers into my face—some with explicit, graphic images advertising sex shows. Security guards stood outside every club, sizing everyone up. It was overwhelming. I felt like I was in the eye of a neon storm, with no way to think clearly, only try to make sense of it.`

The shadows of the swaying leaves danced in the glow of the streetlights, stretching across the sidewalk and onto the sand. I’d see the same scenes again and again.

    We passed street vendors selling ready-to-smoke joints, Viagra substitutes, and children’s toys—often side by side. Children ran through the crowds. Thousands of people moved past, each one a character of their own.`

    It was a different kind of overwhelming. The bars were open-air, low to the ground, close enough to touch. Bar girls lined the fronts, outnumbering everyone else ten to one. Flickering neon bounced off high heels and bare skin. Above the bars, TVs blared European football matches and old Western music videos—Guns N’ Roses, the Eagles, Aerosmith. From every direction came noise: thumping bass, crashing cymbals, screeching guitar solos—colliding with the constant chorus of women’s voices calling into the street. The music, the voices, the scooters, the engines—all tangled into one shapeless, deafening roar.

    Older men perched on bar stools overlooking the street, under a canopy of tiny ceiling fans constantly twirling in different spiral directions, clutched beers wrapped in foam sleeves, trying and failing to keep them cold in the humid night air.`

    Sexy in the City. Slutz on Soi 6. Seduction. Toy Box. Bender—with a giant print of the drunk robot from Futurama out front. Some names sounded like biblical sins: Avarice. Wrath. Lust. A few tried to look classy, but ended up even sleazier. No bouncers. No doors. Just open-front bars, fully exposed. The street was alive—and it was built to feed.

    From the top of the street, I couldn’t see the end. Neon signs blurred into one another. The bars stretched as far as the eye could follow—and outside each, five, ten, sometimes more women waited. Sitting on stools. Smoking. Busy on their smartphones. Scanning every man who passed. If you counted both sides, every bar, every shift—it wasn’t a stretch to say over a thousand women were working Soi 6 at any given moment. And that was just the ones attached to a bar.`

    She once told me she had stopped walking hand in hand with her father when she was barely a teenager—people would mistake them for a mail-order couple, and her dad for her husband. I remember how bizarre it sounded, and how deeply it must have hurt. In Sweden, growing up not looking “ethnically Swedish” already makes life hard enough. In the Philippines, she said, locals would sometimes shout at them in the street, accusing her of betraying her country by marrying an old white man—who was, in fact, her father.

    I thought about that story often in Pattaya. I caught myself hoping, foolishly, that many of the older Western men and young Thai women I saw were actually fathers and daughters. That maybe there was a happier story hidden in the pairings. Even when I saw a very young Thai woman—perhaps even underage—sandwiched between two older Western men on a motorcycle at a traffic light, even though disgust rose in me, I tried to write a kinder story in my head: maybe a father, an uncle, a niece.

    Still, I instinctively took the photo. It’s a photo that haunts me—her distressed expression frozen mid-glance. One I will not share. I didn’t ask permission, and they never noticed me. And after all the time I spent in Pattaya, I know better now. They weren’t family.`

He’d already made a long list of phrases on his phone, transliterated into Turkish—<em>sawatdee khrap</em> became <em>savadikap</em>, easier for me to read and remember. I’d review them before dinner. He was good with people—charming, quick to joke, unafraid to make a fool of himself if it helped build rapport. To a mother holding her toddler, he’d say <em>Nà-làk mâak mâak</em>, meaning very cute. If the heat was unbearable, he’d complain loudly to a stranger: <em>Róon!</em> One night, when it dropped to 22 degrees and locals pulled on hoodies, he hugged himself dramatically and shrieked <em>Namkeng! Namkeng!</em>—ice—rubbing his arms like he was freezing. Maybe he didn’t know the word for <em>cold</em>. But it sure was entertaining.

It was different from Walking Street, where “No Photo” signs hung everywhere, bouncers waved laser pointers at any raised lens, and most of the action was hidden behind closed doors. I didn't go back to the Walking Street again, I wasn't interested in where I couldn't photograph. My teacher told me that when he had first photographed Pattaya, Soi 6 had been more like Walking Street: guarded, closed off, hostile to cameras. But after the pandemic, something had shifted. There were no bouncers anymore. No closed doors. The bars were open to the street. The energy was immediate.`

My teacher usually came with me, offering tips on how to interact. He’d watch both me and the street, and later at home, he’d offer critique—on my presence, what I did or didn’t do.

    I was starting to learn the rhythm: when the music started, when the bar stools were wiped down, when the girls stirred awake and had breakfast right where they’d work later. Later in the day, before customers started rolling in, they’d often sit idly at the bar, eyes glued to their smartphones—scrolling Instagram, dancing for TikTok, replying to messages. It was a digital lull, a quiet prelude to the chaos ahead. When the men began drifting in. Every hour had a different texture. In the afternoon, the street felt softer. There was space. By evening, it grew louder, more compressed, more electric.`

          He’d call me that whenever I was too enthusiastic, acting silly, or trying too hard to charm someone.

From what I gathered, bars pay regular “fees” to operate undisturbed. It’s less about enforcement than about maintaining order, appearances, and income flows.

Whole families with small kids, sometimes even a baby in a stroller, walked right past freelancers leaning against lampposts, haggling with men I’d later see again on Soi 6. Groups of South Asian men often surrounded a single sex worker, which I assumed was for a group engagement. I saw tour buses offloading Indian and Chinese men en masse. Curious, I’d sometimes say hi and ask about their time in Pattaya. The answers could be bizarre—one man told me “Nana Plaza is better,” referring to Bangkok’s bar-packed red-light district. I also heard Turkish often. I assumed the speakers felt at ease many thousand miles from home, and maybe that’s why I caught so many unfiltered conversations—casual bragging, crude jokes, all circling around their exploits. Some men laughed loudly. Others scanned the street in silence.

    During that first visit, I took many photos on Beach Road. I hadn’t yet locked in on Soi 6 as the core of the project. I was just drawn to what was unfolding in front of me—this strange ecosystem where families brushed shoulders with transactional intimacy, children in swimsuits skipped past sex workers in heels.

You could tell even without words: a hand raised to cover their face before I even lifted my camera. I never bothered them. Sometimes, if I took a photo without asking first, I would go up afterward, show it to them, and make sure they were okay with it.

    I'd sometimes need to muster some backing up to myself. I’d show them some of my older photos on Instagram, explain I wasn’t just some random tourist, and promise to send the picture if they wanted. Sometimes, even with a smile, they’d instinctively cover their face or shake their head. I would not push then. That was that. Other times, they’d say they looked ugly or weren’t ready. In those moments, if I felt there was real warmth between us, I’d gently protest: “Kun suay mâak mâak”—you’re very beautiful. More often than not, it cracked a smile and turned the no into a yes. Not always. But enough times to feel like I’d earned the moment.

    Later, I would learn why some women were so cautious. Many had boyfriends, significant others, husbands, or family back in their hometown villages—people who didn’t know they were working in Pattaya. Or if they knew, they believed what they had been told: that she worked at a restaurant, a hotel, or a 7-Eleven. A photograph could unravel a carefully maintained story. And sometimes, it was simply anxiety—a reflex born from living between two worlds.

    While I was still learning the ropes, it was different with the men—especially when they were rude or aggressive toward the women. I didn’t feel the same obligation to ask them. But I’ll get to that later.`

But when I managed to take a photograph that felt real, one that captured something more than a transaction, it somehow made up for it.

    But for most, when I asked where they came from, the answer was always the same: Isan. Isan. Isan. Thailand’s northeast. A rice-farming region. Poor. Hard to leave. After my first few conversations, I went home and started watching YouTube documentaries about it.

    They spoke about their children openly and without shame. In fact, they lit up when I asked. There was a sincere, almost childlike happiness in their voices, in their eyes. They would scroll through photos, laughing, proud. One woman tapped her phone’s lock screen and beamed: “My baby—two year!” Then grinned at me like she’d pulled off a magic trick.

    I’d ask when they last saw their children. It was usually months. Maybe that was a question better left alone. But I cared. I kept wondering about it. I kept trying to make sense of the system that had brought them here—the same system that pulled in millions of men every year.`

Others drifted alone, slowly, trying not to be noticed even as they scanned every bar.

    On Soi 6, there were the usual types: solo men in polo shirts with tanned arms, groups of Brits in football jerseys, retired men with walking sticks, a few younger travelers holding beers, looking amazed and slightly lost at the same time. People of all colors, languages, religions.`

          At the call of “sexy man, handsome man”—shouted with cheerful repetition—some men beamed like schoolboys, delighted at the attention. Others avoided eye contact, unsure how to respond. But for a moment, even the most average man could feel wanted, desirable—even if only because he had cash to spend. I began to suspect that for many, this was the real allure. Not just the promise of <i>boom boom</i>—as the girls referred to sex—, but the warm illusion of being chosen.

One night, out walking along Beach Road, I caught an old man mid-negotiation—his hand resting on a girl’s waist, whispering something into her ear. He had a walking stick. He was old enough to be her great-grandfather. I got pissed off. I lifted my camera and took a shot—point-blank, face to face. He gave me a half-hearted chase, swinging his walking stick and shouting, “Idiot! Come back!” in a thick German accent. I didn’t stop. I didn’t even look back.

    Later at home, my teacher asked, “What were you trying to prove?”`

Or a group of intimidating young men. He reminded me that good photography doesn’t humiliate. It doesn’t create enmity. It observes, reflects, connects. He told me I needed to try to empathize—not just with the sex workers, but with the men too. That moment stayed with me.

    It’s something I’m still learning from him. As he once put it—in Turkish—“Biz insanları ayrıştırmak için çabalamıyoruz, kaynaştırmak için uğraşıyoruz.” We’re not trying to divide people, but to bring them together. There’s plenty we could disagree on, plenty that could pull us apart. But instead, we meet halfway. We find common ground, and choose to look past each other’s flaws.

    That mindset helped me talk to all kinds of people on the street—especially the tourists. If they were Swedish, I’d say, “Bra, jag pratar en liten grann svenska också.” I could hold my own with Norwegians, and catch a word or two from the Danes. If they were French, I’d mention that I religiously practiced Duolingo every day. If they were Welsh, I’d say I used to work with a guy from Caerphilly. Japanese? I had a quote from my favorite anime ready to go. Sometimes I played the like-minded tourist.

    Sometimes I didn’t need to say much at all—just mentioning I was Turkish was enough to spark a conversation. “That’s where I got my hair transplant,” they’d say, or, “I flew there for my teeth.” Cheap and professional, they’d grin, showing their pearly white smiles.`

    I stopped trying to capture shame. Instead, I tried to photograph the reality of it—not the scandal, but the quiet ordinariness.

He was English. We exchanged a few words, I took a photo of him, and then, just as suddenly, he spotted a bar girl. Without hesitation, he wrapped a long shawl he was carrying around her shoulders and pulled her away. She didn’t resist. She just went with him.

    At the time, I didn’t even know about the bar-fine system—how a customer pays a fee, usually between 1,500 and 2,000 baht, to the bar to “take” a woman out. All I knew was that what I had witnessed felt absurd. And it still does—unless I somehow missed him paying.

    I liked the story more than the photo I got. The girl he pulled away kept smiling theatrically for the camera. Even stranger: later that same night, I ran into the Englishman again. He didn’t recognize me at all. He just walked past without a second glance.

    As positive as I tried to keep these encounters with the men, and even though I managed to photograph many of them, I never built any real connection. Each meeting remained exactly that—a single, passing encounter.`

          In addition to traveling to Thailand to investigate the phenomenon firsthand,
          Medin also draws on revealing demographic data.
          According to Sweden’s national statistics agency, 78 percent of Thai migrants to Sweden are women,
          and 80–90 percent of them arrive through a relationship with a Swedish
          man <span

          many of these women live in legally precarious situations:
          their right to stay is tied to the continuation of the relationship.
          If it ends, they risk deportation. Medin describes women who are isolated,
          cut off from support networks, and trapped in controlling or abusive dynamics—treated as housekeepers,
          caregivers, or worse.

Every time I sent her a picture, she’d reply with mock outrage: “Ugly!!! No want photo!” But the next day, there she was again, posing and laughing like nothing had changed. It became our ritual.

    Linda was older than most of the women I met on Soi 6. You could see it in the lines on her face. She said she didn’t have children, and she carried herself with a kind of confidence that stood out. I noticed how the younger girls at her bar looked to her—not with fear, but with a quiet deference. She wasn’t the mamasan; there was already one at her bar. But Linda held her own space.

    When I passed by, she’d sometimes grab my arm and say she was hungry, asking for pizza. There was only one place on Soi 6 that sold it—a little shop crammed between bars. It felt like a luxury amid the usual local stalls. I got her a slice a few times. She’d smile, thank me, and go back to work—unless she wanted ice cream, that is.

    We shared a few drinks together—usually me ordering her a lady-drink and a small Chang for myself. Her English was limited, but she knew how to navigate conversations with customers using her phone and body language. You could tell she’d done it a thousand times.

She posed like an experienced model—serious expression, sharp angles—flowing from one stance to the next while I scrambled to frame her properly amid the chaos of Soi 6.

    Mint became my most enthusiastic model. If I hadn’t shown up one day, she’d text: “I do nice makeup today...no photo?” If I walked past her bar without stopping, she’d run out and drag me back—literally, with strong arms. She was taller than me, stronger too, and completely at ease in her body.

    She didn’t just pose for herself—she brought me in. She’d take me by the wrist and pull me into her bar, introducing me to the other girls: “He is my friend.” That word—friend—mattered. People trusted her, and through her, they started to trust me. Mint gave me access I wouldn’t have earned alone. Her energy, her confidence, her joy in being photographed—it opened doors. She helped me reach the kind of intimacy I was always chasing with my camera.`

Unlike many of the women I met, Namtan didn’t have children, and she moved with a kind of freedom that stood out on Soi 6.

    Her stories were often from upscale clubs on Walking Street—flashing lights, expensive bottles, selfies from the VIP section. Then one day, she posted from a hospital bed—she’d drunk too much. A few hours later, she was back behind the bar, working like nothing had happened. She’d drink a beer with me without hesitation.

    She once told me she had a Western boyfriend who sent her money regularly. But she made good money on her own, too. She didn’t talk about struggle or sacrifice—not in the way others did. Her life felt fast-paced, unstable, but self-directed. She often posted photos with her boyfriend too—a middle-aged man with a shaved head and tattoos—like a badge of stability and sponsorship.

    She reminded me of how Ray Manzarek once described Jim Morrison in his autobiography: someone who could drink until collapse, then get up and keep going like nothing happened. That was Namtan. She burned through nights, smiled at the hangovers, and stayed standing through it all. Not every story on the street followed the same script.

    Still, I made a small album on my phone of what I thought were the best. I showed it to a few friends. They were astonished. A photographer I look up to told me I should get them published—easy for him to say, but I was flattered. Their reactions made me want to return. To go deeper.

    But life in Stockholm was far from great. Work was still draining me. Money was tight. The thought of enduring another few months of Swedish winter filled me with dread. I started looking for another job, but the idea of jumping straight into another software engineering role without a real break felt unbearable. I had no energy left.

    Then in February 2024, my manager set up a meeting. I got fired—part of a global layoff that affected thousands of people across the company. And honestly, I couldn’t have been happier. At least for myself.

    I rented out my Stockholm bedsit, which more or less covered the mortgage, and booked a one-way ticket to Singapore. My teacher joined me there. We walked, took pictures, ate well.

We continued on to the Philippines and Taiwan—two of the few countries in Asia my teacher hadn’t yet visited. I’d been to the Philippines before and helped translate here and there and assumed the tour guide's mantle. A few days after the earthquake in Taiwan we were back in our base. And soon later my teacher returned to Stockholm. Now I was alone.

    What I hadn’t planned for was a motorcycle accident. It happened just before we left for Manila—another motorcyclist crashed into me, and I twisted my ankle badly. I still feel it at the time of writing this, 13 months after the crash and I still haven't managed to see a doctor about it, which is a long story in itself. We, anyways, continued the trip, but my ankle certainly didn't make it easier. After a few weeks of touristing, we returned to Pattaya. During our travels—whether in Singapore, Davao City, or Cebu City—we stumbled upon scenes that echoed Pattaya’s nightlife and sex work culture, though always on a smaller scale. Pattaya remained unmatched in scale, openness, and intensity. And I wasn't ready to deal with that intensity when we returned to Pattaya in April, the pain lingered and I just didn't mentally have the energy to put myself out there. I stayed home some days. But later on, I pushed through. I figured I’d keep photographing for the project while I still had the energy, and start traveling once I needed space. A win-win.

Linda asked if my Taiwanese friend was my “boyfriend.” At first, I thought she was teasing—but later, I learned that the Thai word แฟน (faen) doesn’t specify gender. It just means “romantic partner.”

    We hadn’t talked in a while, so I told her we could get a coffee and catch up once I was back. She said okay.

    When I returned to Pattaya, she messaged again. She said a customer had “bought” her out of the bar and would keep her for the next ten days. “Linda did it because Linda needed money to live like this,” she wrote. “The bar was very quiet.” I asked, “Are you happy?” She replied, “Yes, he is very nice. He is 56 years old.”

    A few days later, the tone changed. “Can’t be with the customer,” she wrote. “He’s doing drugs.” I asked how she was. She eventually told me, “Yes, some days he hurts Linda, but Linda can’t go anywhere, so she has to wait until he returns because he already received his money.”

    When I saw her again during Songkran, she was back at the bar, working like nothing had happened. The whole thing stayed with me—not just what she endured, but the fact that she had reached out to me. Maybe she didn’t have many people to talk to. Maybe she wasn’t looking for help.

I did, however, take more pauses during my walks and spent more time sitting down for drinks, talking with the women. Conversations usually happened over a lady-drink and a smartphone—usually an expensive iPhone—using Google Translate. I’d inadvertently see the translations pop up, along with dozens of other notifications sliding in from the top of their screens: usually messages from foreign men, and usually obscene. It was a strange window into their daily life—something halfway between public and private.

    Phone conversations would also get funny. Over these broken, phone-assisted chats, I was asked more than once if I had a boyfriend or a husband. Sometimes, when a woman proudly showed me photos of her children, I couldn’t help but notice what else was on the screen. In the same photo gallery, right next to pictures of smiling toddlers, there would be dozens of selfies taken with different farangs. It was jarring. Before the night was over, they often asked to take a selfie with me too—adding me, I guess, to that same ongoing gallery.`

It had taken a little convincing—not for permission, but to get her to hold a serious, almost anxious expression. I was hoping to catch that quiet, reflective moment before she stepped back into her shift.

    Then, mid-composure, an African American man burst into the bathroom. I’d seen him earlier at the bar with his friends—loud, cheerful, clearly drunk. He looked at us, flashed a thumbs-up, and without hesitation stumbled straight to the urinal, without so much as even closing the door halfway even. The scene was so absurd it almost made me laugh—but I knew this was a moment worth capturing. He filled in the empty space beside her, a gap that screamed in the frame. Technically, it wasn’t one of my strongest shots—but something about it stayed with me. The absurdity. The composition. The questions. It made the final cut.`

    I asked if I could visit her in Isan. She said I could. By then, I was starting to feel I had to see Isan with my own eyes—to understand what drives so many young women to sex work in Pattaya. I began toying with the idea of expanding the project beyond Soi 6—maybe even developing two parallel photo series. Of course, I had no idea how to do this as a hobby photographer, but I thought May could give me a lead. And the least I could do was take photos.

    But my visa-free month in Thailand was nearly up, ever since we’d returned from Taiwan. I had already booked a flight to Siem Reap in Cambodia—the cheapest international route I could find—to avoid trouble at the border. I figured I’d spend a few days exploring Cambodia, and then return to Thailand with a clearer plan to visit Isan—maybe even by motorcycle.`

          Then I was in Cambodia.
          I went to see Angkor Wat and had a fantastic time touring the temple complex by motorcycle—dodging the $37 entrance fee for foreigners that is lifted just before sunset.
          Originally, my trip was supposed to be just a visa run—but it turned into a much-needed breather from Pattaya.
          I missed being on the road, in more ordinary places, far from the world’s sex tourism capital.
          So I kept going. I forced myself to walk everywhere.
          Slowly, the pain in my ankle began to subside.
          I took photos constantly, slipping into places I doubt many tourists ever did. I visited
          Battambang, the Cardamom Mountains,
          Khemarak Phoumin, Pursat, and Sihanoukville—where I took some of the photos I
          share{" "}

          . I went to Koh Rong, where I even managed a run along the white beach,
          and eventually made it to Kampot—the once French colonial city—before heading to the capital, Phnom Penh.

          My first night in Phnom Penh, I started noticing familiar signs—ads from the Nightwish Group, saying they own more than 30 bars in Pattaya.
          I was immediately alerted.
          The ad was plastered on the side of a passing tuk-tuk and it promoted that they <i>finally</i> opened a bar in Phnom Penh too.
          There I already noticed I was on a red-light street of sorts.
          Not as brazen as Pattaya's any, but I noticed young women idling outside bars on their smartphones.
          A sight not too far off that of Soi 6's bars.
          It must have been the same machinery, just smaller.
          Built on the same logic of exploitation and now one bar by the same people that exploit Thai sex workers in Pattaya.
          It made my stomach turn.
          I remember immediately texting my teacher who was back in Stockholm.
          He said to be careful, and not be too rash to take photos.

I took a photo of this boy next to the bar girls at a bar's entrance in Phnom Penh's red light street. Then I gave him a few coins as pocket money and went in for a beer and to see what it's like. I got my beer, but the mamasan that show my interest in the kid brought him to my table and said he wants an orange juice. I said sure get him one, but she sat the boy on my table next to me and was making him say thank you and everything. I felt really bizarre and soon left. I thought it was her kid, but that bad feeling lingered. Only later, when editing my photos from Cambodia, did the horror hit. I researched. I found reports. I found NGOs fighting child trafficking in Cambodia. I contacted them, but never heard back. But just the sheer fact that such NGOs must exist fills me with dread.

    Sorry for the digression—but it had to be said. After Phnom Penh, I crossed into Vietnam by land, traveling from the south all the way to the north. Then into Laos. I was back to walking again without so much pain, saw wonderful things. I'm grateful for that getaway.`

    On the way, I stopped in Khon Kaen and Udon Thani—two cities in the Isan region, the same part of Thailand where many of the women I’d met in Pattaya had come from. I had hoped to stay longer, to meet people, to see the poor villages they had described. I wanted to understand what made them leave. I wanted to photograph what I found. But I didn’t have time. I passed through quickly, knowing these would be my final days photographing Soi 6.

    I spent my remaining days in June—right up until my flight—on Soi 6. I stayed longer than usual each day, moving slower, shooting more deliberately. I gave it everything I had in those final days, trying to get closer to people. Some of my favorite photos—most of the ones I ended up picking—came from that stretch.`

Some threatened me outright—speaking in British or American accents, telling me not to take photos if I liked my face the way it was. The space felt tighter. And maybe that meant it was time to stop.

    I remember praying for rain. I had never seen Soi 6 in the rain, and I longed for that different kind of light, that different kind of mood. It came—just once. And I went out with my camera. But by then, I’d already exhausted what little energy I had left. That was it.`

My youth felt like it was slipping, and the severance money wasn’t gone yet. I figured if not now, then when?

    I convinced my parents, packed light, and started pedaling from Sweden in late August. I crossed countries slowly, watching autumn unfold one European country at a time, and arrived home just before Christmas—though in Turkey, that’s just another day.`

    My hard drive—where I kept the original files—broke. I neither have the money nor know the right person to attempt a proper recovery. Luckily, I do have backups from before June, and low-resolution JPEG exports for some of the photos from that final week in June.

    Now I don’t know what these photos are for. Will this system ever change? The men won’t stop being rich, and they won’t stop wanting these women. The women won’t stop being poor, and they won’t stop wanting to make money. The Thai government looks the other way, as long as the economy moves and the tourists keep coming.`
