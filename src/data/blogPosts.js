    content: `I’d started photographing that summer with real joy. Earlier in the spring, I’d asked my friend—who’s a published photographer and had taught at several photography schools across Stockholm—if I should sign up for evening classes at one of the schools where he taught. I had recently won a small smartphone photography competition, and the spark was growing. He told me not to bother: “I’ll teach you everything I know.” And he did. He lent me his own camera until I eventually got a discounted demo model of the Fujifilm X-Pro3. We held informal lessons in his kitchen, usually after I finished work. Once I had the technical basics down, he began assigning me themed homework: taxi drivers, nightlife, dreams, midsummer. Each theme was open-ended, leaving room for improvisation. The goal was always the same—approach strangers, build trust, and make photos that spoke to the heart.

    That summer, I went everywhere with my camera—even the toilet. Spare batteries stuffed in my pocket, the camera hung from my left shoulder, slung across my back. Early on, my teacher had corrected me: “Don’t wear it around your neck like a tourist. You’re not taking holiday pictures.” He could be blunt—especially when critiquing my homework—but it came from a place of wanting me to improve. And I did. Or at least, I remember feeling very confident—something I can’t quite explain now, as I write this. Maybe with more experience came more grounding.

    Sometimes I brought other photographers into the mix—people I’d met through mutual circles. We critiqued each other’s work, and I’m still in touch with some of the people I met on the street.

    I spent long hours in his home library. He owns more than a thousand books—mostly doorstops, many by masters. I’d leaf through monographs, street photography collections, retrospective volumes. I cataloged them all for him, and helped sell a few, hoping it might help his finances.

    But by September, our informal kitchen classes came to an end. It was time for my teacher to return to Pattaya, Thailand, where he spent most winters. A friend of his had owned two apartments there but had long since moved to Norway, so he stayed in one of them. Financially—and weather-wise—it made more sense than facing another Swedish winter.

    By winter, Stockholm felt depleted. The days were short, the light cold and gray. My job was draining me. I was buried under my mortgage and rising interest rates. I could barely afford to do the things people did. I remember spending what little remained of my salary on a few screenings at the film festival, then scraping by on potatoes and lentils for the rest of the month. Street photography no longer gave me the same spark it had in the summer. Maybe it’s a weak excuse, but I still think Stockholm isn’t the most exciting place for photography—too clean, too quiet, too conforming.

    I spent most of my time at my teacher’s apartment. He had left me a key before flying out. I’d go there just to browse his library, flipping through the works of photographers I was beginning to call my favorites—Daido Moriyama, Anders Petersen, Mary Ellen Mark, Nan Goldin, and many more. I was drawn to their rawness, their proximity to people and pain. But I also kept returning to the heavyweights of conflict and consequence—James Nachtwey, Don McCullin, Sebastião Salgado, W. Eugene Smith, Kent Klich. Their images captured war, famine, labor, injustice. They made me wonder what photography was for—and what it might still be capable of.

    We were in touch often with my teacher and when I asked him about visiting him in Thailand, he said I could come.`
