    content: `I first arrived in Pattaya in December 2023. My photography teacher—a close friend—had arranged a place for me to stay. It was partly an escape from the Swedish winter, partly wanderlust. I’d heard of Pattaya before—maybe from him, maybe just from its reputation. Either way, I was curious. I had three weeks of vacation from my software engineering job that was slowly killing me, and I decided to take it all.

  I’d started photographing that summer with real joy. At first, I asked my friend—who’s a published photographer and former teacher—about taking evening classes after work. He told me not to bother: “I’ll teach you everything I know.” And he did. We held informal lessons in his kitchen, usually after I’d finished work. Once the technical basics were out of the way, he gave me themed homework: taxi drivers, nightlife, dreams, midsummer. The goal was always the same—approach strangers, build trust, and make portraits that felt honest.

  Sometimes I brought other photographers into the mix—people I’d met through mutual circles. We critiqued each other’s work. Some of the people I met on the street I still keep in touch with.

  I spent long hours in his home library. He owns more than a thousand books—mostly doorstops, many by masters. I’d leaf through monographs, street photography collections, retrospective volumes. I cataloged them all for him, and helped sell a few, hoping it might help his finances.

  But by winter, Stockholm felt depleted. The days were short and gray. My job was draining me. I was buried under my mortgage. I spent most of my time at home. Street photography no longer gave me the same excitement it had in the summer. I needed contrast—something alive, even if chaotic.`

    content: `My teacher was already in Pattaya when I arrived. He welcomed me at the bus station, took me to the flat, handed me a key, and let me rest. The next morning, despite the jetlag, I fell into his rhythm: gym, breakfast, a walk along Beach Road, dinner at the same family-run restaurant every evening. Everything was new. At first, I photographed whatever caught my eye—stray dogs, food carts, fish markets, signs I couldn’t read.

    He spoke a bit of Thai and started teaching me from day one. “Sawatdee khrap” for hello. “Sabai dee mai?” for how are you. “Tai ruup dai mai?” to ask for a photo. He’d already made a long list of phrases on his phone, transliterated into Turkish—sawatdee khrap became savadikap, easier for me to read and remember. I’d review them before dinner. He was good with people—charming, quick to joke, unafraid to make a fool of himself if it helped build rapport. To a mother holding her toddler, he’d say “Nà-làk mâak mâak” (very cute). If the heat was unbearable, he’d complain loudly to a stranger: “Róon!” One night, when it dropped to 22 degrees and locals pulled on hoodies, he hugged himself dramatically and shrieked “Namkeng! Namkeng!”—ice—rubbing his arms like he was freezing. Maybe he didn’t know the word for “cold.” But it sure was entertaining.`

    content: `He pointed out photo opportunities. He translated short conversations. He showed me which alleys were safe, which bars to avoid, where the light hit just right. If I misread a moment or hesitated, he’d tell me what went wrong.

    We scouted Soi 6, Walking Street, Beach Road, and a handful of other places I’ve since forgotten. The scenes were overwhelming: flickering neon bouncing off high heels and bare skin, European football on every screen, music blasting, older men cradling beers, bar girls fixing their lipstick in compact mirrors. On our first night, after what would become our usual after-dinner walk down Beach Road, he brought me to Soi 6. I was stunned—my instinct was to shoot a lot, but from a distance. I couldn’t get close.

    Then on that first night, just to test my limits, he took me to a massive brothel lounge where women lined the walls, each with a number and a color code. The colors marked the price. I wasn’t allowed in with my camera—and even without it, I noticed certain guests, especially South Asian men, being delayed or turned away. On our way out, we stopped to chat with a few Indian tourists lingering at the entrance. I hadn't seen anything like it before.

    We quickly decided Soi 6 was the most photographable street. Narrow, compact, alive. There were motorcycles and the occasional car, but it was walkable. Most people didn’t mind the camera—many vloggers wandered around with selfie sticks already. It was different from Walking Street, where “No Photo” signs are everywhere and bouncers use laser pointers to threaten any raised lens. I’d heard Soi 6 used to be like that before the pandemic. But now, there were no bouncers. No closed doors. The bars were open to the street. The energy was immediate.`
