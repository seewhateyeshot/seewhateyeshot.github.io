        This doesn’t end with a caption. It ends with a scribble I had forgotten about.
        Maybe it says more than the photographs ever could.

        if read aloud slowly, <br />
        at the end of the night <br />
        on an empty street <br />
        after everything’s closed. <br />
        <br />
        some are born to sweet delight ✨ <br />
        <br />
        money here isn’t spent, <br />
        it’s a hit — <br />
        it writes history <br />
        these faces in the thick of it. <br />
        it's a beleaguered hero, <br />
        its accursed superpower? <br />
        a few hundred baht here <br />
        buys an eternity in an hour. <br />
        <br />
        don’t let your piggy bank on Soi 6* <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crash on the floor — nevermore. <br />
        you’ve had enough of pity and mock <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be still writhing on all fours. <br />
        <br />
        praised be money. <br />
        it feeds babies <br />
        and temporarily relieves hungry men. <br />
        this is it: <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cycle of life. <br />
        <br />
        it spreads like a tumor, <br />
        it kills us all slowly. <br />
        <br />
        ask any odd man out <br />
        from the huddled masses — <br />
        Thailand is the true land of the free. <br />
        no one tells you what to do, <br />
        you decide who to be. <br />
        there is a street where the neon glows <br />
        a world-wide welcome everybody knows: <br />
        "bring your horny, your lonely <br />
        broken men with wallets only" <br />
        <br />
        — <br />
        <br />
        the children watch. <br />
        they know the choreography by heart. <br />
        some are still learning how to walk. <br />
        others already know <br />
        how to smile without meaning it, <br />
        playing their part on the puppet row. <br />
        <br />
        — <br />
        <br />
        a girl holds a cyber pony <br />
        like a relic. <br />
        she escapes her fate <br />
        for just a split-second. <br />
        the moment’s already passed. <br />
        <br />
        a mop beside a urinal <br />
        leans by the heels <br />
        of the funeral <br />
        of an unlived life. <br />
        <br />
        the bar backroom smells <br />
        like sweat, <br />
        perfume, <br />
        bleach, <br />
        and other such assorted offerings <br />
        to the small gods <br />
        of daily survival. <br />
        <br />
        — <br />
        <br />
        sometimes <br />
        I think the only honest creature here <br />
        is the dog <br />
        walks the painted lines <br />
        straighter than any man here. <br />
        carrying the bottle through us all <br />
        like it’s worth <br />
        more <br />
        than anything else in this city. <br />
        <br />
        — <br />
        <br />
        this doesn’t end with a bang, <br />
        but with a bottle. <br />
        <br />
        it ends <br />
        the way most things do around here <br />
        poetic, but without meaning. <br />
